{% include doc-header.html %}

Use to wrap content in a nice solid, bordered container. Works well sitting on top of an email body with a <code>.bg-light</code> class.

You can use a card with or without a <code>.card-body</code>. Just like in Bootstrap a <code>.card-body</code> is just used to give padding to the card.

{% highlight html %}
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    This is some text within a card body.
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    This is some text within a card body.
  </div>
</div>
