Bootstrap Email takes most of its inspiration from these two wonderful frameworks, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) but for HTML emails. Working with HTML in emails is never easy because of the nuances of email vs the web. With Bootstrap Email you don't have to understand all the nuance and it allows you to write emails like you would a website.

## Setup
There are a few different ways you can use Bootstrap Email to compile emails:
